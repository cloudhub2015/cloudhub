# The goal of this project is to allow the user to keep track of his/her task for a set project at a given date. 
# To complete the system, a list of tasks is required. He/she can then set the current status of the said task 
# and the time allocated for it. 
# Assume that there is only one project and the limit spent hours for each day is only 8 hrs.
